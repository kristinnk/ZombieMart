Zombie Mart

Tagline: 	Get to the choppa! (Arnold I think)
			Shop til you drop. (Stolen from the zombie boardgame)
			When hell is full, the dead shop at Mart. (Gotta check the MART word)

Premise:
	The player appears in a room in a neightboorhood shop (Think the Apu shop in the simpons, hagkaup, b√≥nus etc). There are two or more doors out of the room one of which is the door to the outside. The player hears zombies bang on the door and can see a hitpoint bar above the door decrease with each bang indicating that a limited time is left. The player is given information that a helicopter is about to arrive to pick up survivors on top of the building. The player has to avoid/kill/slow down the zombies as they follow the player through the building (And some zombies appear inside the building as well due to dead shoppers, employees etc) to the roof within a specific timeframe to survive.

	Short version : The player has to navigate a randomly generated building to the 				rooftop within a short timeframe to survive the zombie apocalipse.


Gameplay walkthrough:
	A building is generated in the form of width, height and floors. At least one of the floors is a shopping area (merchandize in shelves and such) and at least one floor is an office (desks, documents, cubicles, etc). An optional basement with player powerups (better weapons, extra hitpoints, etc) might be generated but is not necessary to survive as it brings big risks in the form of zombies following the player into the basement from which the player has to fight through the horde to reach the top levels again in addition to the detour costing the player time.


Constraints for first version:
	The building generated is max four floors, min one shopping area, min one office.
	The building is max 3x3 floors (BSP tree divived). The time constraint will be a minute for each floor.
